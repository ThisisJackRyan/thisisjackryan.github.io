                    <p>I&#39;m always working on something â€” whether it&#39;s a side project, a school assignment, or something for work. It&#39;s rare that a day goes by where I&#39;m not coding. While I&#39;m still exploring and figuring out my niche in the world of software, web development has been my main focus so far, thanks to both work and personal projects. That said, I do enjoy diving into other areas of software whenever I get the chance.</p>
