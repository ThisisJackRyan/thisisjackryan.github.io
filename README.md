I have done a fair bit of changes recently! If you want to see my old website I made in highschool. It is available at https://archive.thisisjackryan.com/

(I made the new one with next.js for no reason other than reps. I am aware it is 100% overkill given this doesn't have a backend but lowkey i don't care lol.)
