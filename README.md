Hello and Welcome to my GitHub Personal Website! This was my first real React project and really sparked my joy for front-end development. Right now I have three main tabs Projects, GofundMe, and Contact. Projects is just a little profolio of all my bigger projects. Most of the images once hovered upon will play a quick video of the program. The GofundMe tab is honestly a joke. I have a kind of dumb obsession with a japanese kei van and the gofundme just add to the fun of it all. Contact has links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and email. Clicking the email icon will reveal a form that will send me an email with whatever message you put in there.
